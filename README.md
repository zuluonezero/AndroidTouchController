# AndroidTouchController

The base structure for a game controller to be used in a Unity project.

Takes up to two touch points on the phone screen and sends them to the game instance.
X and Y points can be converted into actions in the game.

Code is there for the client and the server instance.
Each one is it's own build and own project - how you wire them up is up to you :)
